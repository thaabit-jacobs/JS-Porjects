//Things I learned: How to dynamically include options into an HTML form
//Things I changed: I created two functions to handle input. One for errors. One for calculating the tip.
//I broke out the feedback into three different feeds. Before, all three would show for just one error.
//Added a validator to only calculate if feedback wasn't received.
//Added a toFixed method to the output
// Made input disappear after submitting
//Bug. I had setInterval in my code instead of setTimeout.
